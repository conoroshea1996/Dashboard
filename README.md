This dashboard provides information on games sales. It gives us some insite into which generes are most
popular and which gaming platform is most in demand plus much more.

## Ui

For User Interface experience I kept my design simple and stuck with what I originally had designed from my wireframes. I also made a conscious decision to build the dashboard for desktop and at a minimum an Ipad sized screen as the graphs become unreadable on smaller devices. I wanted to dashboard to target audiences on larger devices.

#### WireFrames
